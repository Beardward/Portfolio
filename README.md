### A Seasonal Analysis of Electric Vehicle Performance

In the earlier stages of the UMN FM EV Transition Startegy, my team needed to better understand the realistic effects that extreme 
Minneapolis cold could have on electric vehicles. Going into the process, we understood how temperature effects all aspects of electrical car 
components, translating to large effects on EVs. While industry knowledge gave a general idea of the range reduction we had to prepare for, I belived it best to 
source our own data and precisely understand what challenges we must plan around in our unique climate. 

The timeline of the project depended on getting real-time data on existing electric vehicle battery life and charging needs. 
Our real world scenario was compared to published industry standards. Electric vehicle battery usage was tracked for six months between August 1st, 2024 
and February 1st, 2025. All graph columns show the Geotabs-calculated Effective Range Estimate for each vehicle on a full charge, utilizing weather data, 
battery charge levels, historic energy consumption, and distances traveled. Each column is a monthly average across all identical vehicle models in the fleet.
