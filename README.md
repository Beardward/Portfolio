## H2 Data Analysis and Visualization:
In the earlier stages of the UMN FM EV Transition Startegy, my team needed to better understand the realistic effects that extreme           
  Minneapolis cold could have on electric vehicles. Going into the process, we understood how temperature effects all aspects of electrical car 
  components, translating to large effects on EVs. While industry knowledge gave a general idea of what to prepare for, I belived it best to 
  source our own data and precisely understand what we must plan around in our unique climate.
